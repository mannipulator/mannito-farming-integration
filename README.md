## üöÄ Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) provides the easiest installation and update experience:

1. **Install HACS** if you haven't already ([HACS Installation Guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download))
2. **Open HACS** in your Home Assistant instance
3. **Navigate to Integrations**
4. **Click the three dots** (‚ãÆ) in the top right corner
5. **Select "Custom repositories"**
6. **Add this repository:**
   - **URL:** `https://github.com/mannito-farming-solutions/mannito-farming-integration`
   - **Category:** Integration
7. **Click "Add"**
8. **Search for "Mannito Farming"** and click "Install"
9. **Restart Home Assistant**

### Method 2: Manual Installation

For advanced users or custom setups:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [releases page](https://github.com/mannito-farming-solutions/mannito-farming-integration/releases)
2. **Extract the files** and copy the `mannito_farming` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   /config/custom_components/mannito_farming/
   ```
3. **Restart Home Assistant**
4. **Verify installation** by checking the logs for any errors

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Automatic Discovery (Recommended)

If your Mannito Farming controller supports mDNS/Zeroconf advertising, Home Assistant will automatically discover it:

1. **Check for notifications** in the Home Assistant UI
2. **Click "Configure"** when the Mannito Farming device appears
3. **Enter credentials** if required (username/password)
4. **Complete setup** and start using your devices

### Manual Configuration

For controllers without automatic discovery or network-specific setups:

1. **Navigate to Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. **Click "Add Integration"** (+ button in bottom right)
3. **Search for "Mannito Farming"**
4. **Enter connection details:**
   - **Host:** IP address or hostname of your controller (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Username:** Authentication username *(optional)*
   - **Password:** Authentication password *(optional)*
5. **Click "Submit"** to complete configuration

## üè† Device Structure

Once configured, your Mannito Farming controller appears as a single device in Home Assistant with multiple entities:

### Irrigation System
- **Valve 1-5:** `switch.mannito_valve_1` through `switch.mannito_valve_5`
  - Control irrigation zones and water distribution
  - Simple on/off operation with status feedback

### Ventilation System  
- **Fan 1-10:** `fan.mannito_fan_1` through `fan.mannito_fan_10`
  - Variable speed control (1-100%)
  - Individual on/off control
  - Real-time speed monitoring

### Power Management
- **Relay 1-8:** `switch.mannito_relay_1` through `switch.mannito_relay_8`
  - Control high-power devices (pumps, heaters, lights)
  - Safety interlocks and status monitoring

### Fluid Management
- **Pump 1-4:** `switch.mannito_pump_1` through `switch.mannito_pump_4`
  - Dosing and circulation pump control
  - Flow monitoring and safety features

### Environmental Sensors
- **Temperature:** `sensor.mannito_temperature`
- **Humidity:** `sensor.mannito_humidity`

## üîå API Reference

For developers and advanced users, the integration uses these REST API endpoints:

### Device Control
```http
GET  http://{DEVICE_HOST}/api/device/{COMPONENT_NAME}/state
POST http://{DEVICE_HOST}/api/device/{COMPONENT_NAME}/state/{true|false}
POST http://{DEVICE_HOST}/api/device/{COMPONENT_NAME}/speed/{SPEED}
```

### Configuration
```http
GET http://{DEVICE_HOST}/api/device/config
```

### Authentication
The API supports optional HTTP Basic Authentication for secure access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Controller Not Found

**Symptoms:** Integration cannot discover or connect to your controller

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify network connectivity** - Ensure controller and Home Assistant are on the same network
2. **Check IP address** - Try manual configuration with the controller's IP
3. **Firmware compatibility** - Verify your controller firmware supports the required API endpoints
4. **Firewall settings** - Ensure ports are not blocked between devices

### Authentication Issues

**Symptoms:** "Invalid credentials" or authentication errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify credentials** - Double-check username and password
2. **Update firmware** - Ensure controller firmware is current
3. **Check documentation** - Consult your controller's authentication requirements
4. **Reset credentials** - Try resetting authentication on the controller

### Entities Not Updating

**Symptoms:** Device states don't reflect actual controller status

**Solutions:**
1. **Check network stability** - Verify consistent connectivity
2. **Restart integration** - Remove and re-add the integration
3. **Review logs** - Check Home Assistant logs for error messages
4. **Verify API compatibility** - Ensure controller API version is supported

### Performance Issues

**Symptoms:** Slow response times or delays

**Solutions:**
1. **Network optimization** - Use wired connections when possible
2. **Reduce polling frequency** - Adjust update intervals if needed
3. **Controller resources** - Ensure controller isn't overloaded
4. **Home Assistant performance** - Monitor system resources
